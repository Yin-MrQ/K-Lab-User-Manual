#### Modality

The notebook user interface is *modal*. This means that the keyboard behaves differently depending upon the current mode of the notebook. A notebook has two modes: **edit** and **command**.

**Edit mode** is indicated by a green cell border and a prompt showing in the editor area. When a cell is in edit mode, you can type into the cell, like a normal text editor.

**Command mode** is indicated by a grey cell border. When in command mode, the structure of the notebook can be modified as a whole, but the text in individual cells cannot be changed. Most importantly, the keyboard is mapped to a set of shortcuts for efficiently performing notebook and cell actions. For example, pressing **`c`** when in command mode, will copy the current cell; no modifier is needed.
